# Pullback Device: System Design
This repository contains the system design for a pullback device. The device consists of two main components:
- An Arduino, which is used to control the sensors and actuators.
- Sensors or actuators, which are used to detect or respond to the object of interest.

<br/> The first step in designing the system is to determine the Arduino pins that will be used to connect each sensor and actuator. This information can be found in the Arduino_Pins.md file.
